\section*{Introduction}
Have a brief intro about Digital Signatures. Then talk about the relevance of SPHINCS. Important to make note of how SPHINCS integrates multiple technologies and wraps it all together.

\section*{Preliminaries}
This section is utilized to briefly talk about existing signature schemes. The sole reason for this is so future references to the specific schemes are not ambiguous. 

\subsection*{Lamport Signature Scheme}
The Lamport Signature Scheme was created by Leslie Lamport in 1989, and it is the simplest signature scheme that exists. It is also the first One-Time signature that was invented. This scheme makes use of a cryptographic hash function that has already been predetermined. Ideally, the hash output For our purposes, Sha-256 is used to aid in explaining the scheme.\\
\textit{Key Generation}: The signing party is required to generate 256 bit-pairs of random values. This results in 512 total random generated values. These first set of values is the Public Key. Subsequently, each value is ran through the cryptographic hash function once. The hashed values is the Public Key.\\

\textit{Signature Verification}: 

\subsection*{WOTS}
Firstly, it's important to note that the Winternitz signature scheme is one-time. Any amount more and the security of the scheme cannot be promised. The primal idea behind the scheme is having an input run through a hash function several times. The number of iterations entirely depends on the message that needs to be signed.\\
WOTS was built on top of the Lamport signature scheme, and the expectation is for it to be intuitive in its logic, but it's not the case. The complexity of the scheme is heavily influences by the logic in figuring out the number of iterations necessary for a value to go through the hash function.\\
\textit{Key Pair Generation}: A Winternitz parameter w $\geq$ 2 is chosen. The parameter signifies the number of bits that'll get processed at a time. The following 
\begin{equation}
t_{1} = \ceil*{\frac{n}{w}}, t_{2} = \ceil*{\frac{\lfloor log_2{t_{1}} \rfloor + 1 + w}{w}} , t = t_{1} + t_{2}
\end{equation}

\textit{Signature Generation}: 

\textit{Signature Verification}: 

\subsection*{WOTS+}
WOTS+ is very similar to WOTS, expect for the addition of XORing random elements every time a value is iterated over hash function. In the key generation phase, WOTS+ generates a set of random numbers that will serve for XORing. Just like the keys are split into chunks, so are the random elements. They get incorporated in the following recursive chaining function
\begin{equation}
c_{i}^{k}(x,\textbf{r}) = f_{k}(c_{k}^{i-1}(x,\textbf{r}) \oplus r_{i})
\end{equation}
Th equation is strictly $i > 0$, but the in the case of $i = 0$, $c_{0}^{k}(x,\textbf{r}) = x$. The equation is clever in that it makes sure to XOR different values in every iteration. 

\section*{Lamport+ Signature Scheme}
Lamport+ Signature Scheme is a new scheme that we are proposing. It not only brings the simplicity of the original Lamport scheme, but also pulls in elements of the WOTS+ scheme. Our hope is that the original scheme's security is withheld, if not enhanced. Please note that the security of the proposed scheme has not been proven, but it can very well be inferred from the previous.\\
Similar to how WOTS+ introduces XORing of randomized elements to WOTS, the same principle is introduced to Lamport.\\
To start off, a hash parameter needs to be chosen, $l \in \mathbb{N}$, $l > 0$. \\
In the Key generation process, 



\subsection*{Lamport+ Hash Chain}
Explain how Lamport+ Hash Chain works. It's very, very similar to a normal Hash Chain.

\subsection*{Lamport+ Hash Tree}
This piece is not fully developed, but explain how it is headed.

\section*{Benchmark}
This section is for a little graph of RSA and ECDSA times.

\section*{Challenges}
The single biggest challenge for us was primarily getting acquainted with the material. To properly, and throughly, understand SPHINCS we needed to get caught up with a lot of reading. There were multiple papers that required time and dedication to fully understand. Understanding the tools and technologies is crucial if we want to be successful. On top of this, we had the added challenge of figuring out how to piece together the technologies, and how SPHINCS uses them.
