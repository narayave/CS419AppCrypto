\title{SPHINCS Interim Report}
\author{Daniel Kirkpatrick\\Vedanth Narayanan}

\begin{document}

\maketitle


\section*{Introduction}
Have a brief intro about Digital Signatures. Then talk about the relevance of SPHINCS. Important to make note of how SPHINCS integrates multiple technologies and wraps it all together.

\section*{Details}
List out the technologies, along with the different dependencies.\\
Afterwards talk about the ideas that are getting tested out, e.g Lamport+.

\section*{WOTS}
Explain and go through the example.

\section*{WOTS+}
Go through example here.

\section*{Lamport+}
Lamport+ essentially is Lamport with pieces of WOTS+ integrated.

\subsection*{Lamport+ Hash Chain}
Explain how Lamport+ Hash Chain works. It's very, very similar to a normal Hash Chain.

\subsection*{Lamport+ Hash Tree}
This piece is not fully developed, but explain how it is headed.

\section*{Benchmark}
This section is for a little graph of RSA and ECDSA times.

\section*{Conclusion}
